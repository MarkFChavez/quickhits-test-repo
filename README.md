Title: Online Mall


Proposed technical requirements for this project.

* Amazon AWS / Digital Ocean

* PostgreSQL or MySQL

* Possible languages to use:
	- Ruby (Ruby on Rails)
	- PHP (Laravel)
	- Javascript
		Libraries:
			-jQuery

* Setup: (Possible options)
	a. Application will be API-centric. (Not yet sure)
		- Ruby on Rails as an API? (Using Rack-CORS, Rails-API and Custom Serializers for JSON response)
	b. Application will be built using the Laravel framework

	c. Application images will be called via API still undecided if our team will create its own API 
	or use existing API's - axel

	d. 	For the application's front-end i suggest to use a MVC javascript framework still undecided
	between Angular.js or Ember.js - axel
		- I think angular would be better for our application. We are not developing a single page application anyway.
		Also, angular has a cleaner coding style than ember. In ember the html tags are enclosed in script tags. The learning curve of Angular is lower than that of Ember. -lance
	
	e. 	For the application's design i'm suggesting that we use bootstraps latest version RC3 customization 
	of the site might be done after we have decided a layout - axel
